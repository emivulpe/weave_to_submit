				<p> Some teachers have suggested that you would hand them out and take them in again on each lesson where you were using the system.  Alternatively, the pupils just keep their ID safely, for use in the classroom or at home.  You always have the original on paper. </p>

				<p> We do not keep your name or your pupils’ names on-line, so keep the mapping from name to student ID secure.  You can select the columns of student ID here and paste them into a spreadsheet, and keep a more secure copy of name to ID there, if you wish. </p>
